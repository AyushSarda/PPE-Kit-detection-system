 PPE Detection System using YOLOv8
 
This project is a real-time safety monitoring system that detects the presence (or absence) of helmets and vests in industrial environments. The system uses YOLOv8 object detection models and a Tkinter-based GUI for live video inference via webcam or mobile camera (DroidCam).

ðŸ”§ Features
ðŸ“¦ Custom-trained YOLOv8 model on 5 safety-related classes:

helmet

no-helmet

vest

no-vest

person

ðŸŽ¥ Real-time detection via webcam or mobile camera

ðŸ§  Built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter

ðŸ›œ Designed for future CCTV integration in industrial environments
